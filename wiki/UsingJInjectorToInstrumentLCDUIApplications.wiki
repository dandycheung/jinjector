#summary How to instrument J2ME applications which use the LCDUI GUI library

= Introduction =
There are many examples of J2ME applications that use the 
[http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/lcdui/package-summary.html LCDUI] library. JInjector includes classes ( [http://code.google.com/p/jinjector/source/browse/#svn/trunk/jinjector_mobile/decorators_src/com/google/test/jinjector/j2me j2me] ) that facilitate programmatic testing of these applications, including the user-inteface.

This wiki page provides an overview of the steps required to automate tests using JInjector. Example tests are available from the [http://code.google.com/p/jinjector/downloads/list Downloads] section of this project.

_Note: these instructions are likely to change as we enhance the build and configuration scripts. Please visit this wiki from time to time to learn of the updates._
 
== Common stuff required ==
  * Checkout the jinjector_mobile code: svn checkout http://jinjector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jinjector_mobile .
  * Download and copy j2meunit.jar into the lib folder
  * Create a suitable build.xml based on the [http://code.google.com/p/jinjector/source/browse/trunk/jinjector_mobile/build-yourprojectname.xml template] and update the project name e.g. <project name="NetClientMIDlet" default="run-WTK" basedir="."> and machine specific settings e.g. the location of the WTK

== Steps required to instrument an LCDUI application ==
  * Copy source files into src and any res files into res
  * Add build.xml and jinjector.properties
  * Add MANIFEST.MF and projectname.jad to the root folder
  * Edit the contents of MANIFEST.MF and projectname.jad
